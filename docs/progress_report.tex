\section{Model}
We are using Merge-Sort with Parallel Merge on individual nodes. To do this in parallel, we are using Cilk++. 

For utilising multiple nodes, we will be using MPI. For distributing work evenly, we would be picking up pivots <TODO>

\section{Work Done So Far}
We have done the following so far:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We did some I/O benchmarking on our machines and Lonestar. Random reads on our machines take roughly 50 MB/s and about 200 MB/s on Lonestar. 
\item Did some Literature Survey to find that Triton Sort sorts 22.5 GB/s.
\item Then we implemented a Simple Merge Sort, and parallelized it.
\item We wrote a Parallel Merge routine, which finds the median of the merged arra, and splits the arrays to be merged around the median. 
\item We wrote tests to compare Parallel Merge with Serial Merge.
\item We also wrote Bottom-up Merge Sort to find how slow it was in comparison to Top-Down Recursive Merge Sort.
\item Using the Parallel Merge with Parallel Merge Sort, we found out the running time of the algorithm on LoneStar.
\end{enumerate}
